# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Sivasai, and I recently graduated from KL University with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I’ve worked on projects like food image classification using machine learning. I enjoy solving real-world problems using data and programming, especially with Python. I’m looking for an opportunity to work in a dynamic environment, where I can apply my technical skills and grow professionally.
